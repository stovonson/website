## About the project

This is my website. I use it as a base for my other sites, in terms of quality and theme. I also write on here and all of my sites are available on a neat little list.

## Features

- Dark & light mode
- Fully accessible and responsive
- Made with Astro, TS and Tailwind
- My most stable project (lol)
