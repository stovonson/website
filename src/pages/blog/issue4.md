Hello! This is Issue 4 of Delve, and this time, I want to tell you about why change is great, and some of it recently.

The first example of recent times, is my new-found love of Astro. I've talked about it in my previous blog, so this time I'll go more into depth with why I changed.

Over time, I've become more and more dissatisfied with HTML and CSS as languages. In the past, I'd experimented with PHP, but it had got a bad rep, so I steered clear of it.

Soon after, I went straight back to HTML and CSS, despite growing frustrations. Recently though, I got really fed up of changing one link on fifty different pages, so I decided to learn a new language. I hard pivoted to Astro.

The next example of change I've made is surrounding my social media. I used to be absolutely everywhere, and making content for every platform, and multiple channels too.

Obviously, this became too much, and since Feburary I've been cutting down on the amount of content I make, and making less, higher-quality stuff instead.

This ranges from [modpacks](https://modrinth.com/user/stovonson), to [projects](https://stovonson.in/projects/) and [Beets (Bluesky posts)](https://bsky.app/profile/stovonson.in). Maybe in the future I'll make YouTube videos again, but for now I'll stick to my current setup.

Oh yeah: I've got a new modpack coming out soon, [follow me on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/stovonson) to keep up-to-date. I've also added all of my existing modpacks on here!

Well, see you later!
