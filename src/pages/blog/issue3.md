Hello! This is the third post on Delve, and I want to tell you about some improvements I've been making behind-the-scenes to make everything a lot more efficient.

Recently, I've been making a lot of new projects, and I have used HTML, CSS and/or JS for all of them. But, although I'm very good at using them, I feel that I've had a few frustrations over the years with HTML. Specifically:

1. No reusable elements (footers, headers, etc.)
2. Slow page loading (due to client)

All of the above makes blogging and managing sites with a lot of pages and links to those pages difficult to manage. So, after making [Stovetop](https://thestove.top), I really wanted to try a different language. So, I did some research on [FaceDev's new project Vyntr](https://vyntr.com/registry), and I found some really cool sites made with Astro, NextJS and Hugo.

I had tried Hugo before - and found it as inefficient as HTML - and NextJS's performance isn't very good compared to the last option: Astro. I (once again) researched this language I'd never heard of before, and it seemed pretty easy to pick up.

So, I opened Firebase Studio, started a new Astro project, and got to work. I was amazed at how understandable the language and structure of the project was. I kept tinkering with this new toy I had, and then I had a website. In fact, it's the very one you're looking at right now!

That's my Astro story; and if you want to start your own, you can [go to the website](https://astro.build) and start leaning today (not sponsered)! Let me know if you like it and what changes I should make on one of my social medias.

Well, see you later!
