Hello! This is the second post on Delve, and I want to show off my brand new, quite helpful project, [Cookpot](tab:https://cookpot.top).

[Cookpot](tab:https://cookpot.top) is a Markdown README maker, based off of my personal template I've used for all of my Minecraft modpacks on [Modrinth](tab:https://modrinth.com/user/stovonson). I made it to simplify the process of creating README's for myself and others, as I know people don't enjoy making them.

Currently, it's focused on Minecraft modpacks on Modrinth/CurseForge, but I will be adding more features to support more general README standards. In the meantime, please bookmark/share the website to your friends, as more support means more of a drive for me to develop the project more.

That's it for now; you can access Cookpot at [cookpot.top](tab:https://cookpot.top).

Well, see you later!
