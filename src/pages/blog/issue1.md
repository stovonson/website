Hello! This is the first post on Delve, and I want to explain some changes that have happened recently with me.

My name on the internet used to be tunderwood89, and since I wanted to make my name a bit easier to pronounce (no, seriously) I've renamed to stovonson.

Also, I've stopped making video essays on YouTube, because those took ages to make and weren't very enjoyable to record. Instead, I'm gonna probably make some lower quality videos, simply because they are more enjoyable to make.

Oh, and finally, this blog. I've created it so I can write my feelings down, in somewhere that won't change or go, like my social medias or websites.

Well, see you later!
