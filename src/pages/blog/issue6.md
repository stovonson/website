Hello! This is Issue 6 of Delve, and this time, I want to tell you about where I’ve been and what’s coming soon.

Firstly, where I’ve been: on holiday. I won’t go too into depth because I don’t want to share everything personal with - to put it bluntly - random people on the internet. But, to keep it simple, I went to Universal Studios Hollywood for 2 days, then visited family for the rest of the holiday. I really enjoyed the trip, and I came up with some really good ideas while I was there.

The main one I came up with was Snode.link, which is a LittleLink fork, where you can edit the background of the page, shapes of the buttons and so on. It’s currently in development, so expect more soon. Don’t try to get the domain, because I already have it >:). Also literally nothing is on the domain at the moment so don’t even bother putting it in your browser (seriously it’s not worth it).

Anyways, that’s where I’ve been, and that’s what to come. Now I’m gonna go back to playing Far Cry 5 to take the cultists’ cars and my actually awesome underground Minecraft world. In fact, maybe you’ll see that last thing one day, I feel like I’ve gotta show you guys, Maybe in a YouTube video or something. I’ll think about it.

Well, see you later!
