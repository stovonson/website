## About the project

Useful websites I have found, put in a neat little list.

There's quite a few handy filters - and a search bar - so you can find exactly what you want. And if you want to get your own site added to the list, you can do that too!

## Features

- Full of great tools
- Inspired by the 90s
- Fully accessible and responsive
- Made with HTML/CSS/JS
